Faux API is like a open source server for your development needs. It lets you create fake endpoints and responses, so you can test your front-end code without a real backend. It's perfect for quickly trying out ideas or building prototypes hassle-free.

Faux API is free to use with unlimited storage. It provides a valuable service for developers without any cost, making it accessible to anyone who needs to mock APIs during development and testing.
